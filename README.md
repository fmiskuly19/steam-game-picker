# steam-game-picker
React website for Steam users that picks a game to play for any number of players given a list of steam usernames. 

All too often I have found my friends and I having no idea what to play together despite having very large Steam libraries. Every night we would go through our list of games. It was always 1 person didn't own the game, the game was only 2 player, not even multiplayer at all, etc. Always an issue with a game.

At the time I had written a Discord bot for school, and decided to add the functionality to the bot. While this was fine, a Discord bot is a relatively niche use case for this functionality. Obviously a website would be a better medium for this as you can just type the website in the browser, type in the usernames, and boom.

This is my attempt at learning React and porting this functionality into a website. This is a learning experience for me so its very likely some of this code may be bad/incorrect/hacky. I would love feedback for this as I am trying to learn proper React and follow all React best practices.
